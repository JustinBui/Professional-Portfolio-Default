# Professional Portfolio

To gain exposure to  front-end development, I created a professional website 
using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to describe who I am and what I do. This 
website also gives basic contact information such as my GitHub, LinkedIn, 
and Gmail.

I can only show so much through my resume, so making an entire website with colors and
pictures gives even more insight of who I am to employers.

**Warning: This website is only compatible for PC and NOT mobile. However,
I plan to also make it support mobile browsers later on in this project.**
