# Professional Portfolio

To gain exposure to front-end development, I created a professional website
using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to describe who I am and what I do. This
website also gives basic contact information such as my GitHub, LinkedIn,
and Gmail.

I can only show so much through my resume, so making an entire website with colors and
pictures gives even more insight of who I am to employers.
