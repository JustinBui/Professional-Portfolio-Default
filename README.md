# Professional Portfolio

To gain exposure to front-end development, I created a professional website
using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to describe who I am and what I do. This
website also gives basic contact information such as my GitHub, LinkedIn,
and Gmail.

This is an old professional portfolio I've made a while ago, but now I am using this for
my CPSC 362 - Software Engineering course, which requires me to showcase a description of me,
contact information, and previous assignments done in this class.
